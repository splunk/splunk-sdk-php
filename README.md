# The Splunk Software Development Kit for PHP (Preview)

This SDK makes it easy for PHP applications to communicate with and control a Splunk server. Such applications may start searches, display results, and perform administration tasks.

### About Splunk

Splunk is a search engine and analytic environment that uses a distributed
map-reduce architecture to efficiently index, search and process large 
time-varying data sets.

The Splunk product is popular with system administrators for aggregation and
monitoring of IT machine data, security, compliance and a wide variety of other
scenarios that share a requirement to efficiently index, search, analyze and
generate real-time notifications from large volumes of time series data.

### Examples

To run the examples, you will need to install a web server locally that supports PHP.

* On Mac OS X, [MAMP] is recommended.
* On Windows, [XAMPP] is recommended.

[MAMP]: http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html
[XAMPP]: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

Then, move the entire `splunk-sdk-php` directory (containing `examples` and
`Splunk.php`) inside your web server's document root.

* For MAMP, the document root is located at: `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/`
* For XAMPP, the document root is location at: `C:\xampp\htdocs\`

Finally, copy `settings.default.php` in the `examples` directory to
`settings.local.php` and update it with your Splunk server's credentials.

Then you should be able to access the SDK examples via a URL similar to:

	http://localhost:8888/splunk-sdk-php/examples/index.php

(You may need to alter the port of the URL to another value such as `8080` or
 `80`, depending on your web server.)

### Unit Tests

Requirements:

* [PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de/) 3.6+
* [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/) 2.0.5+ (for code coverage)
* Copy `settings.default.php` in the `tests` directory to
  `settings.local.php` and update it with the credentials of a Splunk server
  reserved for testing.

To execute all unit tests, run:

    phpunit tests

To execute only fast unit tests, run:

    phpunit --exclude-group slow tests

To generate a code coverage report, run:

    phpunit --coverage-html coverage tests
    open coverage/Splunk.html

### API Documentation

Requirements:

* [phpDocumentor 2](http://www.phpdoc.org/)

To generate the API documentation, run:

    phpdoc -d Splunk -t apidocs


## Quickstart

The PHP SDK provides an object-oriented interface for interacting with a Splunk server.

To use the SDK, first import `Splunk.php`. This will give you access to all `Splunk_*` classes.

```
require_once 'Splunk.php';
```

Then use an instance of `Splunk_Service` to connect to a Splunk server.

```
$service = new Splunk_Service(array(
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'port' => '8089',
    'username' => 'admin',
    'password' => 'changeme',
));
$service->login();
```

Once connected, you can manipulate various entities on the server,
such as saved searches and search jobs.

For example, the following code runs a quick search and prints out the results.

```
// NOTE: The expression must begin with 'search '
$searchExpression = 'search index=_internal | head 100 | top sourcetype';

// Create oneshot search and get results
$resultsXmlString = $service->getJobs()->createOneshot($searchExpression);
$results = new Splunk_ResultsReader($resultsXmlString);

// Process results
foreach ($results as $result)
{
    if ($result instanceof Splunk_ResultsFieldOrder)
    {
        // Process the field order
        print "FIELDS: " . implode(',', $result->getFieldNames()) . "\r\n";
    }
    else if ($result instanceof Splunk_ResultsMessage)
    {
        // Process a message
        print "[{$result->getType()}] {$result->getText()}\r\n";
    }
    else if (is_array($result))
    {
        // Process a row
        print "{\r\n";
        foreach ($result as $field => $valueOrValues)
        {
            if (is_array($valueOrValues))
            {
                $values = $valueOrValues;
                $valuesString = implode(',', $values);
                print "  {$key} => [{$valuesString}]\r\n";
            }
            else
            {
                $value = $valueOrValues;
                print "  {$key} => {$value}\r\n";
            }
        }
        print "}\r\n";
    }
    else
    {
        // Ignore unknown result type
    }
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Entities and Collections

An *entity* is an object on a Splunk server. This includes saved searches,
search jobs, indexes, inputs, and many others.

Each type of entity lives inside a *collection*.
Each collection type can be accessed on the `Splunk_Service` object.

So, for example, to fetch a list of saved searches or search jobs:

```
$savedSearches = $service->getSavedSearches()->items();  // in the default namespace
$jobs = $service->getJobs()->items();                    // in the default namespace
```

You can also fetch a particular entity in a collection by name:

```
$topSourcetypesSearch = $service->getSavedSearches()->get('Top five sourcetypes');
```

### Namespaces

An entity has a *namespace*, which corresponds to entity's access permissions.

All functions that fetch an individual entity or a list of entities can be
provided a namespace argument. (If you omit this argument, the `Splunk_Service`'s
default namespace will be used.)

So, for example, to get the list of saved searches owned by user `admin` in the
`search` app:

```
$savedSearches = $service->getSavedSearches()->items(array(
	'namespace' => Splunk_Namespace::createUser('admin', 'search'),
));
```

Or to get an individual entity in a namespace:

```
$topSourcetypesSearch = $service->getSavedSearches()->get(
	'Top five sourcetypes',
	Splunk_Namespace::createApp('search'));
```

If you typically access lots of objects in the same namespace, it is possible to
pass a default namespace to the `Splunk_Service` constructor. This allows you to
avoid passing an explicit namespace on every call to `get()` or `items()`.

```
$service = new Splunk_Service(array(
    ...
    'namespace' => Splunk_Namespace::createUser('admin', 'search'),
));
$service->login();

$jobs = $service->getJobs()->items();			// in the admin/search namespace
$indexes = $service->getIndexes()->items(array(	// in the system namespace
	'namespace' => Splunk_Namespace::createSystem(),
));
```

For reference, the types of namespaces are:

* The default namespace - `Splunk_Namespace::createDefault()`
	* Contains entities owned by the authenticated user in that user's default app.
	* For example, if you logged in to `Splunk_Service` as the user `admin` and
	  the default application for that user was `search`, the default namespace
	  would include all entities belonging to `admin` in app `search`.
	* This namespace is used if no explicit namespace is provided.
* A user namespace - `Splunk_Namespace::createUser($owner, $app)`
	* Contains entities owned by a particular user in a particular app.
* An app namespace - `Splunk_Namespace::createApp($app)`
	* Contains entities in a particular app that have no owner .
* A global namespace - `Splunk_Namespace::createGlobal($app)`
	* Contains entities in a particular app that have no owner and that are
	  accessible to all apps.
* The system namespace - `Splunk_Namespace::createSystem()`
	* Contains entities in the `system` app.

## Common Tasks

### Running a Search with a Search Expression

#### Oneshot Searches

For searches that run quickly with a small number of results, it is easiest to
create a *oneshot* search:

```
// NOTE: The expression must begin with 'search '
$searchExpression = 'search index=_internal | head 100 | top sourcetype';

// Create oneshot search and get results
$resultsXmlString = $service->getJobs()->createOneshot($searchExpression);
$results = new Splunk_ResultsReader($resultsXmlString);

// Process results
foreach ($results as $result)
{
    if ($result instanceof Splunk_ResultsFieldOrder)
    {
        // Process the field order
        // ...
    }
    else if ($result instanceof Splunk_ResultsMessage)
    {
        // Process a message
        print "[{$result->getType()}] {$result->getText()}\r\n";
    }
	else if (is_array($result))
    {
        // Process a row
        foreach ($result as $field => $valueOrValues)
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
    else
    {
        // Ignore unknown result type
    }
}
```

A oneshot search blocks until it completes and returns all results immediately.

#### Blocking Search Jobs

For searches that return a large number of results whose progress you don't need
to monitor, it is easiest to create a *blocking* search job:

```
// NOTE: The expression must begin with 'search '
$searchExpression = 'search index=_internal | head 1000';

// Create blocking search job and get results
$job = $service->getJobs()->create($searchExpression, array(
	'exec_mode' => 'blocking',
));
$results = $job->getResults();

// Process results
...
```

Blocking search jobs wait until all results are available.

#### Asynchronous (Normal) Search Jobs

For most searches that could potentially return a large number of results, you
should create an *asynchronous* (normal) search job.

Asynchronous jobs allow you to monitor their progress while they are running.

```
// NOTE: The expression must begin with 'search '
$searchExpression = 'search index=_internal | head 10000';

// Create normal search job
$job = $service->getJobs()->create($searchExpression);

// Wait for job to complete and get results
while (!$job->isDone())
{
	printf("Progress: %03.1f%%\r\n", $job->getProgress() * 100);
	usleep(0.5 * 1000000);
	$job->reload();
}
$results = $job->getResults();

// Process results
...
```

### Running a Saved Search

You can create a normal search job based on a saved search by calling
`dispatch()` on the `Splunk_SavedSearch` object.

```
$savedSearch = $service->getSavedSearches()->get('Top five sourcetypes');

// Create normal search job based on the saved search
$job = $savedSearch->dispatch();

// Wait for job to complete and get results
...

// Process results
...
```

### Running a Realtime Search

A realtime search must be run as an *asynchronous* search job.
The *blocking* and *oneshot* modes do not work, because a realtime search
never actually completes.

To get results from a realtime search, the `getResultsPreviewPage()` method
must be used instead of the `getResults()` method.
