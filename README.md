#### Version 1.0.1

The Splunk Software Development Kit (SDK) for PHP makes it easy for PHP 
applications to communicate with and control a Splunk server. Using the APIs 
exposed by the SDK, applications can start searches, display results, and 
perform administrative tasks.

### About Splunk

Splunk is a search engine and analytic environment that uses a distributed
map-reduce architecture to efficiently index, search and process large 
time-varying data sets.

The Splunk product is popular with system administrators for aggregation and
monitoring of IT machine data, security, compliance, and a wide variety of 
other scenarios that share a requirement to efficiently index, search, analyze, 
and generate real-time notifications from large volumes of time series data.

## License

The Splunk Software Development Kit for PHP is licensed under the Apache
License 2.0. Details can be found in the file [LICENSE].

[LICENSE]: https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-php/blob/master/LICENSE

## Requirements

The Splunk SDK for PHP has been tested with [PHP 5.2.x, 5.3.x, and 5.4.x](http://php.net/downloads.php), with the SimpleXML extension. For best results, use PHP 5.3.7 or higher, or PHP 5.4.x. 

OpenSSL support for PHP is required to access Splunk over `https://` URLs.

If you're using PHP 5.3.6 or earlier, the cURL extension is required as well.
Under this configuration, the SDK will not support streaming large results
when accessing Splunk over `https://` URLs.

## Getting Started

If you haven't already installed Splunk, download it here: 
[http://www.splunk.com/download](http://www.splunk.com/download). 

For more about installing and running Splunk plus system requirements, see
[Installing & Running Splunk](http://dev.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAADRV). 

Get a copy of the Splunk SDK for PHP from [GitHub](https://github.com/) by 
cloning the repository with git:

### Examples

To run the examples, you will need to install a web server locally that 
supports PHP.

* On Mac OS X, [MAMP] is recommended.
* On Windows, [XAMPP] is recommended. You will additionally need to configure 
    PHP to support OpenSSL:
    * Open `C:\xampp\php\php.ini`.
    * Find the line `;extension=php_openssl.dll` and remove the leading 
        semicolon (`;`).
	* Use the XAMPP Control Panel to restart Apache, if it was already
        running.
* On Linux, install Apache and PHP from your package manager.

[MAMP]: http://www.mamp.info/en/index.html
[XAMPP]: http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp.html

Then, move the entire `splunk-sdk-php` directory (containing `examples` and
`Splunk.php`) inside your web server's document root.

* For MAMP, the document root is located at: `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/`
* For XAMPP, the document root is located at: `C:\xampp\htdocs\`

Finally, duplicate `settings.default.php` in the `examples` directory, rename 
the duplicate to `settings.local.php`, and then edit the file. Uncomment the 
`'port'`, `'username'`, and `'password'` fields and update the file with your 
Splunk server's credentials.

You should then be able to access the SDK examples via a URL similar to:

	http://localhost:8888/splunk-sdk-php/examples/index.php

(You may need to alter the port of the URL to another value such as `8080` or
 `80`, depending on your web server.)

If you see an error similar to:

```
Login Failed.
Reason: fopen(https://localhost:8089/services/auth/login): failed to open stream: Invalid argument
```

this means that you need to enable support for OpenSSL in your PHP
configuration (`php.ini`).

### Unit Tests

Requirements:

* [PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de/) 3.6 or later
* [Xdebug](http://xdebug.org/) 2.0.5 or later (for code coverage)
* Duplicate `settings.default.php` in the `tests` directory, rename the 
    duplicate to `settings.local.php`, and then edit the file. Uncomment the 
    `'port'`, `'username'`, and `'password'` fields and update the file with 
    the credentials of a Splunk server reserved for testing.

To execute all unit tests, run:

    phpunit tests

To execute only fast unit tests, run:

    phpunit --exclude-group slow tests

To generate a code coverage report, run:

    phpunit --coverage-html coverage tests
    open coverage/Splunk.html

### API Documentation

Requirements:

* [phpDocumentor 2](http://www.phpdoc.org/)
* [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/) (optional)
    * the **dot** command-line tool is used to render the class hierarchy diagram 
        in the documentation

To generate the API documentation, run:

    phpdoc -d Splunk -t apidocs

### Changelog

You can look at the changelog for each version 
[here](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-php/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).


## Quickstart

The PHP SDK provides an object-oriented interface for interacting with a 
Splunk server.

To use the SDK, first import `Splunk.php`. This will give you access to all 
`Splunk_*` classes.

```
require_once 'Splunk.php';
```

Then use an instance of `Splunk_Service` to connect to a Splunk server.

```
$service = new Splunk_Service(array(
    'host' => 'localhost',
    'port' => '8089',
    'username' => 'admin',
    'password' => 'changeme',
));
$service->login();
```

Once connected, you can manipulate various entities on the server,
such as saved searches and search jobs.

For example, the following code runs a quick search and prints out the results.

```
// NOTE: The expression must begin with 'search ' or '| '
$searchExpression = 'search index=_internal | head 100 | top sourcetype';

// Create oneshot search and get results
$resultsXmlString = $service->getJobs()->createOneshot($searchExpression);
$results = new Splunk_ResultsReader($resultsXmlString);

// Process results
foreach ($results as $result)
{
    if ($result instanceof Splunk_ResultsFieldOrder)
    {
        // Process the field order
        print "FIELDS: " . implode(',', $result->getFieldNames()) . "\r\n";
    }
    else if ($result instanceof Splunk_ResultsMessage)
    {
        // Process a message
        print "[{$result->getType()}] {$result->getText()}\r\n";
    }
    else if (is_array($result))
    {
        // Process a row
        print "{\r\n";
        foreach ($result as $key => $valueOrValues)
        {
            if (is_array($valueOrValues))
            {
                $values = $valueOrValues;
                $valuesString = implode(',', $values);
                print "  {$key} => [{$valuesString}]\r\n";
            }
            else
            {
                $value = $valueOrValues;
                print "  {$key} => {$value}\r\n";
            }
        }
        print "}\r\n";
    }
    else
    {
        // Ignore unknown result type
    }
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Entities and Collections

An *entity* is an object on a Splunk server. This includes saved searches,
search jobs, indexes, inputs, and many others.

Each type of entity lives inside a *collection*.
Each collection type can be accessed on the `Splunk_Service` object.

So, for example, to retrieve a list of saved searches or search jobs:

```
$savedSearches = $service->getSavedSearches()->items();  // in the default namespace
$jobs = $service->getJobs()->items();                    // in the default namespace
```

You can also retrieve a particular entity in a collection by name:

```
$topSourcetypesSearch = $service->getSavedSearches()->get('Top five sourcetypes');
```

### Namespaces

An entity has a *namespace*, which corresponds to the entity's access 
permissions.

All functions that retrieve an individual entity or a list of entities can be
provided a namespace argument. (If you omit this argument, the 
`Splunk_Service`'s default namespace will be used.)

So, for example, to retrieve the list of saved searches owned by user `admin` 
in the `search` app:

```
$savedSearches = $service->getSavedSearches()->items(array(
	'namespace' => Splunk_Namespace::createUser('admin', 'search'),
));
```

Or, to retrieve an individual entity in a namespace:

```
$topSourcetypesSearch = $service->getSavedSearches()->get(
	'Top five sourcetypes',
	Splunk_Namespace::createApp('search'));
```

If you typically access many objects in the same namespace, it is possible to
pass a default namespace to the `Splunk_Service` constructor. This allows you 
to avoid passing an explicit namespace on every call to `get()` or `items()`.

```
$service = new Splunk_Service(array(
    ...
    'namespace' => Splunk_Namespace::createUser('admin', 'search'),
));
$service->login();

$jobs = $service->getJobs()->items();			// in the admin/search namespace
$indexes = $service->getIndexes()->items(array(	// in the system namespace
	'namespace' => Splunk_Namespace::createSystem(),
));
```
The types of namespaces are described here:

| Type     | Name                                         | Description        |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Default  | `Splunk_Namespace::createDefault()`          | Contains entities owned by the authenticated user in that user's default app. For example, if you logged in to `Splunk_Service` as the user `admin` and the default application for that user was `search`, the default namespace would include all entities belonging to `admin` in app `search`. This namespace is used if no explicit namespace is provided. |
| User     | `Splunk_Namespace::createUser($owner, $app)` | Contains entities owned by a particular user in a particular app. |
| App      | `Splunk_Namespace::createApp($app)`          | Contains entities in a particular app that have no owner. |
| Global   | `Splunk_Namespace::createGlobal($app)`       | Contains entities in a particular app that have no owner and that are accessible to all apps. |
| System   | `Splunk_Namespace::createSyste ()`           | Contains entities in the `system` app. |


## Common Tasks

### Running a Search with a Search Expression

#### Oneshot Searches

For searches that run quickly with a small number of results, it is easiest to
create a *oneshot* search:

```
// NOTE: The expression must begin with 'search ' or '| '
$searchExpression = 'search index=_internal | head 100 | top sourcetype';

// Create oneshot search and get results
$resultsXmlString = $service->getJobs()->createOneshot($searchExpression);
$results = new Splunk_ResultsReader($resultsXmlString);

// Process results
foreach ($results as $result)
{
    if ($result instanceof Splunk_ResultsFieldOrder)
    {
        // Process the field order
        // ...
    }
    else if ($result instanceof Splunk_ResultsMessage)
    {
        // Process a message
        print "[{$result->getType()}] {$result->getText()}\r\n";
    }
	else if (is_array($result))
    {
        // Process a row
        foreach ($result as $key => $valueOrValues)
        {
            // ...
        }
    }
    else
    {
        // Ignore unknown result type
    }
}
```

A oneshot search blocks until it completes and returns all results immediately.

#### Blocking Search Jobs

For searches that return a large number of results whose progress you don't 
need to monitor, it is easiest to create a *blocking* search job:

```
// NOTE: The expression must begin with 'search ' or '| '
$searchExpression = 'search index=_internal | head 1000';

// Create blocking search job and get results
$job = $service->getJobs()->create($searchExpression, array(
	'exec_mode' => 'blocking',
));
$results = $job->getResults();

// Process results
...
```

Blocking search jobs wait until all results are available.

#### Asynchronous (Normal) Search Jobs

For most searches that could potentially return a large number of results, you
should create an *asynchronous* (normal) search job.

Asynchronous jobs allow you to monitor their progress while they are running.

```
// NOTE: The expression must begin with 'search ' or '| '
$searchExpression = 'search index=_internal | head 10000';

// Create normal search job
$job = $service->getJobs()->create($searchExpression);

// Wait for job to complete and get results
while (!$job->isDone())
{
	printf("Progress: %03.1f%%\r\n", $job->getProgress() * 100);
	usleep(0.5 * 1000000);
	$job->refresh();
}
$results = $job->getResults();

// Process results
...
```

### Running a Saved Search

You can create a normal search job based on a saved search by calling the
`dispatch()` method on the `Splunk_SavedSearch` object.

```
$savedSearch = $service->getSavedSearches()->get('Top five sourcetypes');

// Create normal search job based on the saved search
$job = $savedSearch->dispatch();

// Wait for job to complete and get results
...

// Process results
...
```

### Running a Realtime Search

A realtime search must be run as an *asynchronous* search job.
The *blocking* and *oneshot* modes do not work, because a realtime search
never actually completes.

To get results from a realtime search, the `getResultsPreviewPage()` method
must be used instead of the `getResults()` method.
