/**
 * Represents a response received from an HTTP request.

 * 
 * Has the following read-only properties:
 * - status {integer}   HTTP status code (ex: 200).
 * - reason {string}    HTTP reason string (ex: 'OK').
 * - headers {array}    Dictionary of headers. (ex: array('Content-Length' => '0')).
 * - body {string}      Content of the response, as a single byte string.
 * - bodyStream {resource}
 *                      Content of the response, as a stream (of the type
 *                      returned by fopen()).
